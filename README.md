# Erg.ai: a real-time erging analyzer

## Overview
Inspired by my competitive rowing background, I built a computer vision biomechanics analyzer that can provide real-time video overlays for erg videos.

## Technical stuff
- OpenCV and MediaPipe for pose detection on erg film,
- Expoentinal Moving Average's for glitch removal within videos
## Calculations 
- Knee and body angles,
- Stroke rate
- Similarity to reference strokes (from scraped youtube videos).
